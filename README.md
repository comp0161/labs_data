# labs_data

Some basic starter data for the generative music lab sessions. This repo
will be cloned to the Colab VMs to provide a jumping off point, but other
files can also be added and used instead.

* `corpus.txt`: this is the music training data generated by the default
  configuration in Lab 1 (where it is called `bach_mozart_haydn.txt`)
* `music.mid`: the final (primer-based) MIDI file generated by the
  default configuration in Lab 2
* `sines.sf2`: a simple alternative soundfont for use in Lab 3, in which
  all the non-percussion sounds are just sine waves (public domain data,
  from the [Polyphone Soundfonts Collection](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/documents/27-instrument-sets/571-sinewaves-everywhere-except-drumkit))
